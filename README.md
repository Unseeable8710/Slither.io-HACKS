# Slither.io HACKS

## About

There are a lot of mods out there to modify Slither.io, but I couldn't really find any that were cheats, so I decided to make one.

## Installation

1. To use this, you must have [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/), [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/), or any other userscript manager.
2. Download any version of your choice. If you have a userscript manager, then you will (hopefully) see a tab open asking you to confirm the installation.
3. Click "Install", "Upgrade", or "Reinstall", depending on what button you are shown.

## How to use

Press Ctrl+I to increase your length by the default amount.
